# MNIST DATASETS PROJECT


This is a MNIST Dataset project of  Integier recogniser with 
ability of multilabel recognisation and it also contains confusion
matrix, recall, precision, and f1-score.
I plot various graphs to understand relation b/w precision and 
recalls and threshold, and there need to make our model not only
accurate but also effective.



*I try my best to complete MNIST dataset of Integier recogniser
if there are any mistake done my me fell free to tell me to 
correct it and if any this left by me please suggest me so i 
can add it to my project with my full potential*
